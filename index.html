<p>Solar markets have gone through boom and bust cycles in the media over the past several year - from being as a sole hope agains the climate change, or highly-public bankrupcies and a failed technology and back. Nevertheless, out in the real world, solar market was gradually taking shape, and it grew from bellow 1% of the national electricity output to a little above 5% today (<a href='http://www.eia.gov/energy_in_brief/article/renewable_electricity.cfm'>EIA</a>). </p>
<p><b>Market </b>Residential PV solar segment refers to small scale (<1MW) solar installations deployed for private use - and is about a third of total solar market. Over the past several years, residential solar has benefitted from increased integration with the grid and attractive net metering rules. Today more that a million of US households have a PV solar-installed on their property, and the market is on track to double by the end of the year (<a href='http://www.seia.org/research-resources/us-solar-market-insight'>SEIA</a>).</p>

<p><b>Growth of Residencial Solar PV capacity 2000 - 2016</b></p>

<p> <b>Legislative framework </b> Solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) - a cornerstone federal policy mechanism since 2006 - was extended till the end of the decade earlier this year. As a result, solar can enjoy the same market stability that allowed them to grow almost 1600% over the last decade (SEIA). At the same time, the state-regulated net metering rules and utility-rate structures vary across the country, and distributed solar is very sensitive to these changes.</p> 
<p><b>Competition </b> Competitive landscape is rather fragmented geographically, however, there are several major companies that have offices nation-wide (SunRun, SolarCity, Vivint Solar, First Solar etc.)</p>
<p><b>Product </b> Solar panels can differ by size and capacity. The amount of electricity generated at a particular site will depend greatly on the amount of sunlite available in that area (in that respect, southwestern United States is the most efficient region). In the same way,  the economics of a solar installation will vary depending on the output (and consequently, utility bill savings), availability of solar rebate programs, subsidies, and other incentives (tax, exemptions and credits).</p>

<p>The premise of this project is that growth of solar markets is correlated with higher energy prices, population with a higher income level, benefitial legislature, and level of solar adoption to date. </p>

<p>After comparing several ML classification algorythms, I chose Random Forest Classifier for further analysis since it gives the lowest MSE lavel. </p>

<p>This week I took a deeper dive into the base assumptions of the project (more about that in my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BI3jlIo2hZI">Week 1 video</a>). The heart of the project is the Open PV database - crowd-sourcing platform for collecting data on the size of the PV market. The database is initiated and supported by the National Renewable Energy Library (NREL), and has accumulated over 400k entries from utilities, installer companies and private owners. Let's take a look at how solar PV installations were growing across the country between 2000 and 2015. </p>

<img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17014207/16100818/eab65a24-3315-11e6-8b7f-68cf4e718028.png" alt="New solar PV capacity" style="width:330px;height:255px;">

<p>There is a certain lag in the reporting of installed capacity, which is why 2015 is showing a decline, so we will focus on 2000-2014 where data are more comprehensive. In monthly installed capacity, we see irregular spikes in installed capacity, and once we look into that in more detail- it turns out they reflect large one-time installations in different states. </p>

<p>The next two map help us visualize the data. On the  below maps the solar PV capacity growth over the past 15 years. The base layer of the map shows the average energy price for electricity in that states over the same period of time. It is clear that high prices and PV capacity growth is correlated.  </p>

<p>A surprise factor is that the most robust solar markets are only marginally correlated with areas of the highest solar radiation in the USA - see the propensity of solar in states like New York, Connecticut and Illinois! Even more surprising - growth of solar in states with both low solar radiation and low utility prices - such as Montana, Wyoming, Idaho and Washington.</p>
