<p>This week I took a deeper dive into the base assumptions of the project (more about that in my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BI3jlIo2hZI">Week 1 video</a>). The heart of the project is the Open PV database - crowd-sourcing platform for collecting data on the size of the PV market. The database is initiated and supported by the National Renewable Energy Library (NREL), and has accumulated over 400k entries from utilities, installer companies and private owners. Let's take a look at how solar PV installations were growing across the country between 2000 and 2015. </p>

<p>There is a certain lag in the reporting of installed capacity, which is why 2015 is showing a decline, so we will focus on 2000-2014 where data are more comprehensive. In monthly installed capacity, we see irregular spikes in installed capacity, and once we look into that in more detail- it turns out they reflect large one-time installations in different states. </p>

<p>The next two map help us visualize the data. On the  below maps the solar PV capacity growth over the past 15 years. The base layer of the map shows the average energy price for electricity in that states over the same period of time. It is clear that high prices and PV capacity growth is correlated.  </p>

<p>A surprise factor is that the most robust solar markets are only marginally correlated with areas of the highest solar radiation in the USA - see the propensity of solar in states like New York, Connecticut and Illinois! Even more surprising - growth of solar in states with both low solar radiation and low utility prices - such as Montana, Wyoming, Idaho and Washington.</p>

<p>I hypothesis that there are three domains that determine the variability of solar market growth.</p>

<p>After comparing several ML classification algorythms, I chose Random Forest Classifier for further analysis since if gives the lowest MSE lavel. </p>
